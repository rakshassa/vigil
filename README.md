- track rounds in a single combat to allow trinkets/abilities to trigger on specific rounds
- trinkets - special modifiers with positive/negative tradeoffs
- switch get/post verbs
- increment time/date - trigger boss fights
- non-battle encounters

- implement all actions
    - jeweler, bard, scouts
