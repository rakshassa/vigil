# TODO

- track rounds in a single combat to allow trinkets/abilities to trigger on specific rounds
- trinkets - special modifiers with positive/negative tradeoffs - unlimited carry
- potions - one time use (max carry)
- switch get/post verbs
- non-battle encounters

- Action: jeweler
- Action: scouts

UX
=====
- NOTICE bar at the top should be styled better

DEFER
=========
- login
- start-game screen (select character, challenges, modifiers)
